# Kitchen Sink Plugin

## Version Bumps

When bumping the version, update BOTH files:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the `version` field
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — the `version` field in both `metadata` and the plugin entry under `plugins[]`

All three version strings must match. If they drift, Claude Code's plugin cache serves stale versions.
